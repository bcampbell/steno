libui:
- uiEntry: no event for when user presses enter (OnChange fires on every key) (Gtk: want activate signal)
- uiTable: no way to change entire data set
- uiTable: gtk autosizing causes horizontal scrollbar on wide columns
- uiTable: no click/doubleclick event (can do both on win32 and osx, but catching both in gtk required deeper hacking))
