STENO - OCTOBER
=====================================

w/c 5/10

try and slim down win32 build
  currently using big bloated debug versions of the GUI toolkit.
  Should be possible to get it to use the (much smaller) release version
  instead.

better slurp interface (gui):
  + slurp multiple days
  + better filtering options (eg just grab dailymail)
  + preview options (eg show article counts per day as you browse
    calender, say)

Send new build to GR and MM

---------

w/c 12/10

TESTING: GR & MM to test new build and feedback

finish query language
  - missing date/number ranges

support column sorting for tags, keywords, bylines

mac link-clicking bug

data export experiments
  - just try out a few things and see if any good

better display of dates

----------

w/c 19/10

in-app documentation:
  - general intro
  - query language syntax and examples
  - scripting

speed up tagging/untagging
  - the issue is that bleve requires full reindexing of modified documents
    so adding/removing tags from a whole bunch at once can be slow.

Send new build to GR and MM

----------

w/c 26/10

TESTING: GR & MM to test new build and feedback

figure out licensing/source release if any

Documentation on server side
  - how to set up a server
  - how to configure publications


FURTHER OUT (ie November, in no particular order)
---------------------------------------------------

would be nice to have an icon/logo for it

access tokens (api) - to govern and track other users of our servers

manual article entry/editing

publicise it more!

add retweet flag during server-side tweet processing

server-side shortlink embiggening?
  - might be better leaving it in the client side after all... it's
    an inexact process and requires a little hand-holding

Assorted Server-side improvements
  - better logging, notifications etc...
