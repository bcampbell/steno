STENO - TODOs
==============

support range searches on published column
  (proper date representation in steno)

fix mac link-clicking bug

data export experiments

client-side documentation:
  - general intro
  - query language syntax and examples
  - scripting

figure out licensing/source release if any

Documentation for server side
  - how to set up a server
  - how to configure publications

serverside diagnostics
  - summary API (collate daily article counts by publication)
  - summary GUI (using api)

article content view (the bottom pane)
  - support clipboard copy
  - clickable links

mac build
  - proper code signing (aka offical Apple blessing ritual)

progress display during article delete



FURTHER OUT
-----------

would be nice to have an icon/logo for it

access tokens (api) - to govern and track other users of our servers

manual article entry/editing

publicise it more!

add retweet flag during server-side tweet processing

server-side shortlink embiggening?
  - might be better leaving it in the client side after all... it's
    an inexact process and requires a little hand-holding

Assorted Server-side improvements
  - graceful shutdown
  - reload config (ie add new scrapers on the fly)

Slurp GUI
  - show article counts per day
  - proper article count in progress display
