STENO - NEXT 4 WEEKS (in rough order)
=====================================

this week:
---------

busy/progress dialog for all lengthy operations

all links should be clickable

---------

try and slim down win32 build
  currently using big bloated debug versions of the GUI toolkit.
  Should be possible to get it to use the (much smaller) release version
  instead.

finish query language
  - missing date/number ranges

support column sorting for tags, keywords, bylines

---------

better slurp interface (gui):
  + slurp multiple days
  + better filtering options (eg just grab dailymail)
  + preview options (eg show article counts per day as you browse
    calender, say)


mac link-clicking bug

data export experiments
  - just try out a few things and see if any good

better display of dates

----------

in-app documentation:
  - general intro
  - query language syntax and examples
  - scripting

speed up tagging/untagging
  - the issue is that bleve requires full reindexing of modified documents
    so adding/removing tags from a whole bunch at once can be slow.



FURTHER OUT (>4 weeks away, in no particular order)
---------------------------------------------------

would be nice to have an icon/logo for it

access tokens (api) - to govern and track other users of our servers

manual article entry/editing

figure out licensing/source release if any
  - suggest Affero GPL all round. Free for all to use and contribute to,
    but nobody can build on it unless they're prepared to be open source.
    TODO: if we want to be able to build closed stuff on top of it, then
    we need to be able to license it. At the moment, MST owns all the code.
    However, if we get contributions from other people, they will own those
    changes. So we either need agreement from them to use their work under
    non-AGPL terms, or get them to assign over the copyright.


publicise it more!

add retweet flag during server-side tweet processing

server-side shortlink embiggening?
  - might be better leaving it in the client side after all... it's
    an inexact process and requires a little hand-holding

Documentation on server side
  - how to set up a server
  - how to configure publications

Assorted Server-side improvements
  - better logging, notifications etc...
